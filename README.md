Fully-connected neural network for predicting optical properties and inverse design of core-shell nanoshperes. The purpose of this project is to recreate a study by Peurifoy et al. titled 'Nanophotonic particle simulation and inverse designusing artificial neural networks'. Their code and data can be found at https://github.com/iguanaus/ScatterNet. 

Code for the transfer matrix used to generate training data can be found in the TM directory

Code for the fully-connected neural network is located in the FCNN directory
